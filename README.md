This is a project to determine soil moisture variations
spatially. In this project we deployed 4 soil moisture sensors at various distances from tree to determine the variations of 
soil moisture contents at various regions in the soil. The data measured is then send to Onem2m server and also its graphical
representation is being analyzed by sending the data on 'Thingspeak'.
